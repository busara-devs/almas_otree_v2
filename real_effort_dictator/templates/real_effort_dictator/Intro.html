            You and another participant are now paired. You have both worked on the slider tasks and
            earned 25. Together you have earned 50. You are now going to determine how
            much of the 50 you suggest for yourself and how much you suggest for the other participant.
            You are free to choose any amount in whole shillings between 0 and 50. Examples:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. If you assign 50 KSh to you, the other participant gets 0 KSh.
        </p>
            2. If you assign 25 KSh to you, the other participant gets 25 KSh.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. If you assign 0 KSh to you, the other participant gets 50 KSh.
