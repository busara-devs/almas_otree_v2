                In this part of the experiment, you earn money from conducting a sequence of tasks over 3 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each task, you are asked to move a slider on the right to match an image shown to you on the left.
                Try to correctly move the slider to match the goal as many times as you can, within 3 minutes. The more
                times you match the slider correctly, the higher your earnings.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be a practice round before the actual task begins.
