                You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another player.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this game one of you will be allocated <strong> 50 Ksh</strong>, Then one of you will be selected at
                random and given the opportunity to give part of the sum to the other player.
                Before the chosen amount reaches the second player, it will automatically be tripled by the experimenter.
                In other words, the second player will receive three times the amount originally given by the first player.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second player will then be given a similar opportunity, namely to give part of the now-tripled sum back to the first player.
