            In this part of the experiment you will complete a series of tasks. For each
            task, you are shown a pattern with a piece missing. Identify the correct answer by selecting the missing
            piece that completes the pattern.

            Your earnings from this part of the experiment will be given in the form of amazon gift cards.
            Your earnings from this depend on the number of correctly completed patterns (out of a total of six) that you complete correctly,
            and on a decision that another player makes in the next round.
