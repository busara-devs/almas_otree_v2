                On the following screens you will find a series of four questions. In each question, you are asked to
                make decisions involving earnings over time.
                Each row features a series of options, consisting of a sooner payment and a later payment.
                There is a trade-off between the sooner payment and the later payment across the options.
                Please choose the option that you prefer. There are no right or wrong answers.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you make your choices for all four questions, the computer will randomly select one of the questions.
                Your earnings from this part of the experiment are your choice for the question selected by the computer.
