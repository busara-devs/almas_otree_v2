                Second round (Participant B): You are now randomly matched with another participant (not yourself) from the first round, Participant A.
                In the first round Participant A chose to send you <strong>{{ player.get_others_in_group.0.sent_amount }} tokens</strong>.
                This amount has been multiplied by 3, to make a total of {{ tripled_amount }} tokens.
                You can now choose to send back some of this total to Participant A. Any amount not sent to Participant A, will be yours to keep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your earnings from this part of the experiment depend only on the choice you make in this round.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that the other participant will not be able to know that you are paired with them, nor will you know which other participant is paired with you.
                Your choice is anonymous.
