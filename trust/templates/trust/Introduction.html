                In this part of the experiment, you are endowed with KSH 170. In the next round another participant,
                “B”,
                will be matched with you. Participant B is not given anything. You can choose to send any amount,
                between 0 and KSH 170, to Participant B. Any amount not sent to Participant B, is yours to keep. Any amount
                you
                send to Participant B is multiplied by 3. In the second round, Participant B can choose to send back
                some or
                all of this amount to you. Any amount that is not sent back to you by Participant B is kept by
                Participant B.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your earnings from this part of the experiment depend on the choice you make in this first round as well
                as the choice of one other Participant B in the next round.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that the other participant will not be able to know that you are paired with them, nor will
                you know which other participant is paired with you. Your choice is anonymous.
