                In this task, you make a choice between different amounts of money that you can receive based on a toss
                of a coin. You have the choice between seven coins, each with different payouts for heads and tails.
                Once you have chosen, the computer will toss a virtual coin representing the coin you have chosen. The
                coin has an equal chance of landing on heads or on tails.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your earnings from this part of the experiment depend on your choice and the result of the coin toss.
                Therefore, it is in your interest to carefully pick the option you truly prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the 7 different coins from which you will choose one:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coin 1: [ Ksh 0 if heads and Ksh 270 if tails]</li>
                <li>Coin 2: [ Ksh 30 if heads and Ksh 210 if tails]</li>
                <li>Coin 3: [ Ksh 50 if heads and Ksh 170 if tails]</li>
                <li>Coin 4: [ Ksh 70 if heads and Ksh 130 if tails]</li>
                <li>Coin 5: [ Ksh 80 if heads and Ksh 110 if tails]</li>
                <li>Coin 6: [ Ksh 90 if heads and Ksh 90 if tails]</li>
                <li>Coin 7: [ Ksh 100 if heads and Ksh 70 if tails]</li>
            </ul>
