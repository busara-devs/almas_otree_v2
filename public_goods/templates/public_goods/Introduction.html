You and the other participants are each                endowed with 1200 tokens, as indicated on your screens. You must decide how much of your endowment to                put into a shared fund. At the same time that you make your choice, the other two participants will                simultaneously decide how many tokens to put into the shared fund. Each token put into the fund is                multiplied by 2. The shared fund is then split equally between the three of you. Each token you choose                not to put into the fund is yours to keep.            </p>            <p>                Your earnings from this part of the experiment depend on your choice and the choice of two other                participants in the experiment.            </p>            <p>                Please note that the other participant will not be able to know that you are paired with them, nor will                you know which other participants are paired with you. Your choice is anonymous.            </p>        </div>    </div>    <p><strong>Please click "Next" to continue"</strong></p>    {% next_button %}{% endblock %}
