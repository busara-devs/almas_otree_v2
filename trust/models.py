In the trust game, the participants are matched in pairs where
one of them, participant A, is given a fixed amount of money, say X KSH and the other,
participant B, is not given any money. Participant A can decide to keep the money, in
which case player A will receive the actual payment of X KSH and player B will receive
nothing. Participant A can also decide to send part or all of the money, Y <= X to
player B in which case player B will receive 3Y KSH. In this case player B is given the
option to send money back to player A (any amount he or she likes). If participant A
trusts that some money will be sent back, he or she will benefit from sending the money
to participant B. If, on the other hand, the trust is lower, participant A may decide
to keep the money. Hence, the amount sent from A measures the level of trust of the
participants. The amount sent back from B, reveals the trustworthiness which is also an
interesting measure to study in itself.
