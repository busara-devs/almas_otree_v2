                In this task, you make a choice between different amounts of money that you can receive based on a toss
                of a coin. You have the choice between seven coins, each with different payouts for heads and tails.
                All coins
                have an equal chance of landing on heads or on tails. Once you have chosen, the computer will toss a
                virtual
                coin representing the coin you have chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your earnings from this part of the experiment depend on your choice and the result of the coin toss.
                Therefore, it is in your interest to carefully pick the option you truly prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the 7 different coins from which you will choose one:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coin 1: KSH 0  if heads and KSH 820 if tails</li>
                <li>Coin 2: KSH 70  if heads and KSH 350  if tails</li>
                <li>Coin 3: KSH 140  if heads and KSH 550  if tails</li>
                <li>Coin 4: KSH 210  if heads and KSH 410  if tails</li>
                <li>Coin 5: KSH 240  if heads and KSH 340  if tails</li>
                <li>Coin 6: KSH 275  if heads and KSH 275  if tails</li>
                <li>Coin 7: KSH 310  if heads and KSH 210  if tails</li>
