You and the other participants are each                endowed with <strong>Ksh 50</strong>, as indicated on your screens. You must decide how much of your                endowment                to put into a shared fund. At the same time that you make your choice, the other two participants will                simultaneously decide how much to put into the shared fund. Each [cent / shilling] put into the fund is                multiplied by 2. The shared fund is then split equally between the three of you. Each [cent / shilling]                you choose not put into the fund will be yours to keep.            </p>            <p>                Your earnings from this part of the experiment depends on your choice and the choice of two other                participants in the experiment.            </p>            <p>                Please note that the other participant will not be able to know that you are paired with them, nor will                you know which other participants are paired with you. Your choice is anonymous.            </p>        </div>    </div>    <p><strong>Click Next to continue.</strong></p>    {% next_button %}{% endblock %}
