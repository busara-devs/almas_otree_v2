        <p>On the following screens you wil find a series of questions. In each question, you are asked
        to choose between Option A and Option B.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you choose Option A, you will get a smaller amount but sooner. If you choose Option B,
        you will get a larger amount but later. Please choose the option you prefer. There are no
        right or wrong answers.
        </p>
        <p>
        After you make all your choices, the computer will randomly pick one of the questions and
        your payment will be determined by the option you chose in that question.
        Remember that the computer will pick only one question and any question could be picked.
        </p>
        <p>
        Therefore, it is in your interest to answer each question as if it is the only question you are
        answering.
